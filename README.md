# TCDSoftwareEngineering

This is the central repository for our Software Engineering module - CS3012.

## Overview

In this repository, one can find all the assignments that have been worked on
over the course of the semester. These projects are the following:
- Lowest Common Ancestor implemented with Binary Tree and D.A.G (Assignment 1-2)
⋅⋅⋅ To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a
    directed acyclic graph, that may initially be structured as a binary tree.
- Biography Of an Influential Software Engineer (Linus Torvalds)
⋅⋅⋅ To produce a short (2-4 page) biography of a key software engineer,
    discussing the work and impact of the individual.
- Measuring Engineering - A Report
⋅⋅⋅ To deliver a report that considers the ways in which the software
    engineering process can be measured and assessed in terms of measurable data,
    an overview of the computational platforms available to perform this work,
    the algorithmic approaches available, and the ethics concerns surrounding
    this kind of analytics.
- GitHub Application
⋅⋅⋅ Interrogate the GitHub API to build visualisation of data available that
    elucidates some aspect of the software engineering process, such as a social
    graph of developers and projects, or a visualisation of individual of team
    performance.

All assignments contain documentation which includes install instructions.
